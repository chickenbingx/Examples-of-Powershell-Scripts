# Exchange Migration Scripts

* 01 - Gather Ad Sec Group permissions on Shared MBs *
* 02 - Add Explicit Permissions onto Shared Mailboxes *
* 03 - Remove AD Sec Group from permissions on Shared MB *

These Scripts where part of a little project to prepare the shared mailboxes for migration to Exchange Online. We needed to remove any permissions on shared mailboxes which were applied using a AD security group, as Exchange Online doesnt support on-premise AD groups.
