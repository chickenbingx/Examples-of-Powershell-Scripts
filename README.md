## Exchange Migration Scripts

__*01 - Gather Ad Sec Group permissions on Shared MBs*__
__*02 - Add Explicit Permissions onto Shared Mailboxes*__
__*03 - Remove AD Sec Group from permissions on Shared MB*__

These Scripts where part of a little project to prepare the shared mailboxes for migration to Exchange Online. We needed to remove any permissions on shared mailboxes which were applied using a AD security group, as Exchange Online doesnt support on-premise AD groups. We sucuessfully went through over 1000 shared mailboxes within an afternoon to allow for a faster migration.
